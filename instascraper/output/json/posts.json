THIS IS A MUST GET WHEN GOING HHO!! their deep fried luncheon meat and their deep fried fish also goes well with mala. the fried luncheon meat was full of flavour and their deep fried fish was soft and tasty. do rmbr to get bigger slices for the fish because when they deep fry it, the pieces get smaller!!! 🤔🤔🤔 \n\nI did not really understand the idea of scrambled eggs with mala at first, but I was WOWED when I had my first mouth of their scrambled eggs alongside the mala tang! THE EGGS WERE SERVED AS DESCRIBED! IT WAS SOFT, FLUFFY AND HAD A CREAMY TEXTURE! its a must order for me regardless of whether I’m eating dry or soup. It will make the whole experience better!!! 😉😉😉\n\nwhat makes hho stand out from the other mala stores would be the fact that they offer deep fried options for these ingredients. I went to one of the thye guan mala outlets that day and they unfortunately could not deep fry it😂😂. WHAT R U WAITING FOR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN GO AND EAT HHO IF U HAVENT!!! 😊WE R IN 2024!!! \n\n#food #foodporn #singapore #singaporefood #singaporefoodie #ilovefood #iloveeating #eat #mala #ahothideout #ahothideoutsg",

What can I say. This bowl of noodles is the most perfect bowl of noodles you can find in SG. 😄 The broth is insanely thick and the flavour is super duper good. U know ur eating  REAL, LEGIT ramen when you eat at brothers ramen. I added spice cos I’m a spice lover and oh my god. It’s GOD tier. The nooodles also super QQ. I even added noodles and I absolutely destroyed the whole bowl(on my story). DO NOT CALL URSELF A RAMEN LOVER IF U NEVER EAT BROTHERS RAMEN. \n\nAs for their signature brothers ramen, it has more soup and more like traditional ramen. (Slide 678). As you can clearly see, the egg alrdy looks bussin. The whole bowl is cooked to perfection. I always add noodles and finish the whole bowl. But I don’t care cos it’s BROTHERS RAMEN🔥🔥🔥. I think this would be more suitable to everyone as it’s less salty compared to the megamen, because the megamen has less soup. But again, you can adjust the saltiness level of ur ramen while ordering, so you have not excuses not to come here. 😉\n\nFor the price of only 13.90 each for such a big bowl of megamen and brothers ramen, and the fact that it’s located RIGHT SMACK in the middle of cbd, there is really nth u can complain about. And this ramen store opens only from 11-2.45pm and 6-7.45pm, and yet their queues are insane. I rmbr having to queue over like 1 hour one time. But I don’t care because I love brothers ramen. And I love being a fatty Bom Bom. \nAnd Ok, I’m gonna be honest, u already know it’s good when you see actual JAPANESE people queueing for this ramen shop. This is the ONLY shop in Singapore where I see Japanese ppl queueing for the food. So yall better come down and try. Don’t say BOJIO. LET ME SAY THIS AGAIN. BEST RAMEN IN SINGAPORE!!! 😋😋😋\n\n#singapore #ramen #singaporefood #food #ilovefood #foodporn #instagood",

Quality of the meat is definitely there, way better than the average Bak Kut teh chains u can find in shopping malls. 🤣\n\nReally love their soup as well, super rich in flavour. One thing that stands out for the soup will be the peppery taste it has, def makes the soup a lil bit more spicy, but it also makes it way more flavourful. The long-simmered pork ribs infuse the soup with a deep umami taste, balanced by the warm sweetness of the garlic. Def must come here if you’re looking for good BKT!! 😏😁\n\nTheir side dishes, such as the salted veg and youtiao were pretty good as well! Tho the youtiao didn’t have anything special to it, the salted vegs packs a garlicky flavour, with the right amount of saltiness. Worth ordering!! 🥰🥰🥰\n\nOverall, Founders Bak Kut Teh offers a very traditional and authentic dining experience. I would say it’s worth travelling down and enjoy a good bowl of Bak Kut teh, so come down for urselves and try it!! 😀😀😀\n\n#singapore #food #foodporn #foodphotography #foodstagram #sg #sgfood #sgfoodie #goodfood #chinesefood #ilovefood #foodie #sgeats #sgfoodlover #singaporefood #chinesefoodlover #tourism",

(It’s said that this restaurant is the BIRTHPLACE of Chili crab itself, so… u can expect super good Chili crab here 😏😏)\n\nTheir chili crab is definitely the best dish here. The crab was fresh, meat was tender, and sauce was super rich in flavour. 😱😱😱It had the right amount of spice in it and the egg in the sauce gave it a silky and creamy texture. 😆😆😆 Definitely a dish worth ordering when you are here!!\n\nTheir other seafood dishes(black sauce prawns on slide 4 and their sea bass on slide 10) were amazing as well! Black sauce had a savoury sweet bland, where they combined soy sauce together with other aromatics to create this layer of glaze that clings to each prawn!! Prawns used were big too! 👍👍 Loved their fish as well, the soup wasn’t too strong nor too bland. Fish was cooked to perfection 😁\n\nOverall, this place definitely serves super good and high quality zichar with reasonable and large portions, though it may def be on the pricier side.(got the special birthday menu that day!) Do come down and give it a try, ESPECIALLY THEIR CHILI CRAB!!

Super thick and rich in flavour, and mad spicy as well(they have options till weiweila for those who can’t take spice!) \n\nTheir dishes are super affordable as well 😌one plate of meat costs roughly 9$!

The taste was super balanced,not too salty yet still tasty. 😋😋😋 The chashu was also frickin tender 🤩🤩, probably one of the BEST, if not the BEST chashu I’ve eaten in a ramen ngl. The egg was also super runny, loved the consistency of it and how it’s cooked to perfection 😍😍😍. If you are looking for something spicy, then definitely get the spicy one. SUPER FLAVORFUL😙😙😙. Don’t believe me? See pic 8 for evidence 😎\n\nTheir pan-fried Gyozas are also a MUST GET WHEN UR THERE!! The amazing chaoda and crispy layer at the bottom makes the gyoza 1000000x better. PROMISE ITS GOOD!!! 👍 Not to forget their edamame also rocks.(not sure why, my mom said it’s nice so i will just add it here lol)\n\nOverall, would give this place an 8/10!! The store was super vibes and reminded me a lil bit of japan 😂 Def one of the better bowls of ramen you can have in sg, tho it may be a lil pricey for the location(that’s the price u have to pay for good food ig😂😂) I will def be back here again to have more ramen HAHA.

As someone who dislikes broccoli😤, gawddamn it was bussin HAHA. Super crispy and when added together with their seasoning, it def hits the right spots 🔥🔥🔥\n\nTheir pork belly with enoki mushrooms are worth mentioning as well. Deep fried enoki mushrooms give a super crunchy texture when u bite down on it, with their juicy pork belly 😮‍💨😮‍💨. Definitely a must get!!\n\nAnd they also offer maggi mee with egg at 2.50$ only! Though it’s just maggi mee, it was super vibes and it came well together when eating loklok. Highly recommend the curry flavour one especially 👍👍👍\n\nOverall I wld rate this an 8/10!

The bburinkle chicken was super delicious and had lots of cheese and vegetable seasoning that made the chicken super flavorful. Cheese seasoning was not too thicc, so won’t feel jelat when eating it!! 😋😋 As a fried chicken lover, I will rate this an 8/10! Will definitely order this if I come here again! \n\nThe red king chicken was surprisingly good as well(super underrated!!). It was spicy(not say too spicy), but also had a bit of sweetness as well! The garlic added also made the chicken way more yummy. For those who love spicy food, I would recommend getting this! (Tho it may be slightly pricy😅) This is an 8/10 for me as well! 😄😄 \n\nOverall, this place is worth a try!! The quality of the chicken was super duper good(chicken came hot and juicy 😛😛😛) and it’s no doubt better than most of the fried chicken we have in SG. Definitely reminds me of the bhc chicken I had in Korea… 🥹  Will come back again and try the other flavours and dishes as well.😀😀\n\n#food #foodporn #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodblogger #chicken #chickenwings #friedchicken #instagood #ilovefood #foodie #sg #sgfood #sgfoodie #bhcchicken #sgeats",

The soup was super sweet and super delicious. It definitely exceeded my expectations😋😋😋. The flavour of the soup was really on point, not too bland or salty!! You can add the wine (花雕酒) into the soup which makes the soup way more flavourful. Add in abit of garlic and chilli padi and the soup IS PERFECT 🤗🤗. The soup is easily 9/10!! Must get this when you come.  And of course not forgetting the clams! There’s arnd 1kg worth of lala inside, which I feel is just nice for 2-3 people.\n\nFor the ingredients, we ordered their pork shoulder slice, marbled pork slice, chicken slice, signature fish paste and some vegetables. All the meat were super fresh and portions were big as well compared to sg😂 \n\nOverall, I feel this place is a must try! It’s cheap compared to the ones we have in Singapore. (spent around 150rm for 2, so roughly 25$ SGD per person) However, the downside will be that there may be long queues during dinner hours and weekends, so make sure to come early to avoid the queue!! It also opens till 3am, so it can be a good supper spot if you’re planning to go jb and have some good food😋😋😋 Can get quite hot sometimes when you are eating as ur outdoors, but no complains cos food is BUSSIN 🤣🤣🤣 I will definitely come back again!! Overall 8/10. \n\n#food #foodporn #ilovefood #singapore #hotpot #sg #malaysiafood #singaporefood #foodie #jb #sgfood #daitaolalapot #foodgasm #foodpics #singaporefoodie",

I loved everything about this... the crispy golden brown hashbrowns paired with the lettuce and the luncheon meat 🫨🫨🫨 together with the sunny side up and cheddar cheese🧀😍🤩 it was the perfect\nmix!!\n\nLOXU: 9/10!!!!! IF YOU LOVE SALMON AND CREAM CHEESE YOU MUST GET THIS!! They were super generous with the salmon, and the smoked salmon was super fresh and balanced, without an overpowering fish smell. The best part about this is the ratio of the cream cheese to salmon. The cream cheese is not too strong, so even for people who are not a big fan of cream cheese(Eg me), you can still ENJOY the whole masterpiece without it feeling jelat or oily. The onions and the tomatoes also brought extra flavour. U HAVE TO TRY THIS!!! 😇😇😇\n\nOf course you cannot forget the bagels themselves!! The bagels here are really super good. Super crunchy exterior with a soft, dense and slightly sweet interior. 😚There are\n3 bagel types to choose from as well!! We got the plain one and I can already say that it’s alrdy super delicious. Will definitely come down again to try the sesame one!!\n\nLocated in the CBD area, with their big ass bagels priced at only 13-16$, I would say that this is a STEAL!! I promise you that the bagels are bigger than what it looks like in pictures and that it’s definitely worth ur money!! 🤗🤗🤗COME DOWN AND TRY!!! 😝😝😝\n\n#sg #sgfood #bagel #bagels #cafe #cafeteria #food #foodporn #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodblogger #goodfood #ilovefood #instagram #foodie #singapore #singaporefoodie #foodislife",

We got the Tenerai Matcha Latte and the Wakaba Matcha Latte. \n\nThe Tenerai Matcha Latte was a 6/10 for me. Tho I can taste the authenticity of the matcha, it was not anything too special for me. It was said to be light and refreshing as well, but I felt that the Wakaba Matcha Latte was more refreshing instead😂😂. For the price of 8.90$, I feel that it did not live up to its price point 😓\n\nThe Wakaba Matcha Latte was a 7/10 for me. It felt super refreshing when drinking, followed by a strong matcha aftertaste which I prefer more over the other one. I would say that the Wakaba is a better option if you are planning to head down here!!\n\nOverall, as a matcha lover, I would say that the quality of matcha here is decent, but for the price im paying, I wouldn’t say it’s exactly worth it. (Maybe when im employed then it’s different). My go to will still be HVALA HAHAHA! Anyways come down and give it a try if you are around the area!! \n\n#food #foodporn #foodie #singapore #sg #sgfood #drinks #drink #cafe #latte #matcha #matchalatte #matchalover #cafehopping #singaporelife #foodgasm #drinkcoffee #drinktea #coffeelovers",

And it’s in a coffeeshop!!!\n\nStumbled across this when I was walking around looking for food in Marsiling, and GAWD DAMN this western food is LIFE CHANGING 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨. We ordered their chicken cutlet with pasta, their carbonara, and their crispy onion rings.  The chicken cutlet was legit super crispy and the pasta was cooked to perfection. Easily already a 7/10. The highlight of this dish however would be the tartar sauce. I expected the tartar sauce to taste like McD fillet o fish sauce(I hate that), but omg the sauce was legit so so delicious. It had a similar taste to wingstop ranch, but it’s texture is not as thick. When paired with the chicken, it easily brings this dish up to a 9/10!! 🫨🫨🫨 \n\nThe carbonara was also CRAZY. The RICH, CREAMY sauce and the Al Dente pasta paired with the super flavourful bacon 🥓… this dish is definitely on another level!!! I am not a carbonara fan but I can vouch that you MUST have this when you come here!! It’s hard to explain through words… so come and try it for urselves 🫢🫢🫢. For the price of only 9.90$, u can’t get any better carbonara out there!! \n\nOnion rings were also super crispy as well. Came with fries, but nothing really special about it. Just ur standard sides I guess 😂😂.\n\nOverall, I would give this place a 7.5/10 and I will definitely come back again!! Especially since it’s located in a coffeeshop and that it’s cheaper than other western food u can find in shopping malls. For its quality, this is definitely better than any western food u can find in coffee shops. This is a HIDDEN GEM 💎 for me. Do try it if you are in the area and I promise u won’t regret 😋😋😋\n\n#food #foodporn #foodphotography #foodstagram #singapore #sg #sgfood #sgfoodie #goodfood #westernfood #ilovefood #foodie #sgeats #sgfoodlover #singaporefood",

(FUJI edition😎😎)\n\nSaw this place on my lemon8 and TikTok, so had no choice but to head down and give it a try. This place did NOT disappoint!!! 😋 \n\nWe ordered their signature pancake(pic 1 and 2) and tiramisu pancake(pic 3 and 4). OMG they were so fluffy and soft this is legit the first time I come across pancakes with such texture. The tiramisu pancakes also came with a coffee dip. When dipped inside, you can taste the well mixed flavours of the coffee and tiramisu. SUPER GOOD!! I would easily rate the pancakes here an 8/10.  For the price of only 1180yen for their original pancakes(around 11-12SGD~), it’s better than any of the pancakes I had in sg!! \n\nNext up we ordered their hot chocolate and I was WOWed by it!! The chocolate was super GAO(thick) and not too sweet. JUST NICE for my taste buds😁. I recommend getting this when the weather is super chilly (the day we went it was 20-21degrees) and I promise u confirm drink until SHIOKKKKK. \n\nThis place is a must visit when you are coming to Japan and mt fuji area!! The highlight of this cafe is that they have outdoor seats(where I’m sitting) that provide you with panoramic views of Mount fuji and lake yamanaka. Unfortunately when we arrived to this cafe, the clouds were blocking MT Fuji so we couldn’t see it…😭 but nonetheless this place is still super vibes!! Fun fact if you come during the winter at around 830am or 4pm, there’s a chance you get to see swans in the lake right in front of u 😱😱😱 Do drop by when you are visiting Mount fuji!! 🤩\n\n#food #foodporn #foodstagram #sgfood #japan #japanesefood #mountfuji #lakeyamanaka #goodfood #ilovefood #pancakes #pancakelover #bussin #singapore #singaporefood #instagood #foodie",

(Pics 19 and 20) got the chocolate mochi and oh my god. This was insane!! U MUST GET IT WHEN YOU COME HERE😮‍💨 not too sweet, and the chocolate goes so well together with the strawberry. let me repeat, u must eat!! the taiyakis were alright as well, wouldn’t say too special, but would be nice to try it since you are there😝 \n\n#food #foodie #foodporn #ilovefood #ilovejapanesefood #foodiesg #singaporefoodie #izakaya #foodisgood #japan #japantrip #japanfood #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodgasm #sgfoodreview",

This was honestly super good 👍 The herbs together with the garlic made the whole dish smell fantastic. The dish fried together with the chili also makes it 10 times more flavorful. Easily an 8/10 for me!! 😋😋\n\nThe hunan style stir fried pork (pics 3 and 4) is also another must order when you come here!! The wok hey was super strong, and the texture of the meat was soft and tender. Fried together with the sauce, and paired with rice, this dish is a BANGERRRRRR. Honestly the taste of their stir fried pork reminded me of the stir fried pork I ate recently in China😮‍💨 I would say this dish is an easy 8/10 as well. Please get this when you come here!!!🔥🔥🔥\n\nThe golden broth sour and spicy fish (pics 5 and 6)was however,  unfortunately disappointing 😢😢😢. The broth did not taste sour and spicy at all for me, but rather just the super strong lemon taste. The broth was just filled with lemon, and tho there was peppercorn inside, I couldn’t taste any of it. Maybe it’s just me, but I personally am not a fan of this dish and wouldn’t order it again.😔 maybe it’s a me problem but idk. Yall can try it and let me know!! 🙂 so sorry but this is a 4/10 for me 😅\n\nThe last dish we ordered was the sour and spicy potatoes, which was super disappointing as well…😮 I personally am not a fan of the potatoes as it’s way too sour to my likings. I personally do not like my food to be extremely sour, hence this is a pass for me 😕 however if you do like food that is quite sour, I would say that this dish would be perfect for u😙😙😙. This is a 4/10 for me 😔\n\nOverall it’s not bad! I think if you like China food then go for it! Tho it may be abit on the pricier side, I think u make ur money worth when you order the right dishes!! 😚😚😚",

Accompanied with the thick black sauce, this is easily a 10/10 for me! SUPER DELISH YUMZZZZ🤤🤤🤤🤤\n\ncome down to this shop if you are nearby and I promise u will not regret! 🙏🙏🙏\n\n#food #shanghaifood #shanghaifoodie #singapore #singaporefood #singaporelife #ilovefood #foodporn #foodpornshare #china #chinafood",

A golden-brown crunchy crust on the outside, with tender and a soft texture that’s easy to bite into. For the price of 15-20yuan, it was definitely worth getting. Would rate this a solid 9/10!\n\nlast but not least, THE cream of the crop, the crab roe XLBs!!!! The XLBS were filled with rich, vibrant orange crab roe.  The best part of the xlbs was the mix of flavour between the crab roe and the pork fillings. This is easily a 10/10 for me! 😋😋😋 It was so good that we ordered 1 more portion of this 🤗🤗🤗 PLEASE GET THIS IF YOU COME HERE!!! \n\n#food #foodporn #singapore #singaporefood #singaporefoodie #musttry #shanghai #ilovefood #xiaolongbao #healthyfood #foodie #singaporelife",
